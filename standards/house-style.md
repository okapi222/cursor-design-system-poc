# House Style (POC)

## Voice (what the UI should feel like)
- Calm, clear, and professional.
- Prefer simple layouts over busy ones.
- Use whitespace to reduce clutter.

## Layout
- Use an 8px spacing grid.
- Prefer a max content width of 1200px on desktop screens.
- Use consistent padding inside cards/containers (16–24px).

- Use a clear type scale:
  - H1: 32px
  - H2: 24px
  - H3: 20px
  - Body: 16px
  - Small: 14px
- Line height: ~1.4–1.6 for body text.

## Color
- One primary brand color for main actions.
- Neutral grays for backgrounds, borders, and text.
- Avoid using bright colors for large background areas.
- Use semantic colors:
  - Success (green), Warning (amber), Error (red), Info (blue).

## Components
- Buttons:
  - Primary button is the default for the main action.
  - Use Secondary for less important actions.
